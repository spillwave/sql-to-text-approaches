# Project Scope: Natural Language Retail Analytics System
## POC Version 1.0

### Project Overview
The proof-of-concept will develop a natural language interface for analyzing historical retail transaction data. The system will provide both textual and visual analytics through a chat-based interface, designed primarily for management-level users.

### Primary Objectives
1. Create a natural language processing system capable of interpreting and responding to complex retail-related queries
2. Provide automated visualization of relevant data alongside query responses
3. Implement automatic detection and highlighting of critical findings
4. Deliver insights within 1-minute response time

### Dataset Specifications
- **Source Data**: Point-of-sale transaction data from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/youssefismail20/sql-e-commerce/input
- **Time Period**: 9/4/2016 to 10/17/2018
- **Data Granularity**: Transaction-level detail


### Core Functionality Requirements
1. **Query Processing**
   - Natural language interpretation of retail-specific terminology
   - Support for complex queries about:
     - Sales performance
     - Inventory turnover
     - Customer behavior
     - Product categories
     - Operational efficiency

2. **Data Analysis**
   - Statistical analysis capabilities
   - Anomaly detection
   - Trend analysis
   - Pattern recognition in purchasing behavior
   - Automatic identification of critical events

3. **Visualization Capabilities**
   - Auto-generated graphs based on query context
   - Time-series visualization
   - Category-based visualization
   - Anomaly highlighting
   - Interactive data exploration
   - Tabular data presentation

4. **User Interface**
   - Chat-based interface
   - Concurrent display of text responses and visualizations
   - Ability to export or share findings
   - Web-based access

### Example Supported Queries
1. "What is the average transaction value over the period?"
2. "Are there any anomalies in sales patterns that indicate inventory issues?"
3. "What are the peak shopping hours and associated revenue?"
4. "What product categories show the strongest correlation with total basket value?"

### Performance Requirements
- Query response time: â‰¤ 1 minute
- System availability: Standard business hours
- Data refresh rate: Not applicable (historical data analysis)
- Visualization rendering: Near real-time after query processing

### Success Criteria
1. Accurate interpretation of at least 90% of standard retail queries
2. Generation of relevant visualizations for time-series and category-based analyses
3. Successful identification of critical sales events and anomalies
4. Meeting the 1-minute response time requirement
5. Positive user feedback from management team testing

### Out of Scope
- Real-time data processing
- Multiple store analysis
- Mobile application development
- Custom alert configuration
- Data input or modification capabilities
- Integration with other retail systems
